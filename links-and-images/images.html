        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>
            This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking
            for <a href="links.html">links</a> and
            <a href="misc/extras.html">useful extras</a>
        </p>

        <h2>JPGs</h2>

        <p>JPG images are good for photos</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes
                without exorbitantly increasing file size
            </li>
            <li>
                This makes them great for photos and images with lots of
                gradients
            </li>
            <li>They <em>can't</em> have transparent pixels, though.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" alt="mochi jpg" />

        <h2>GIFs</h2>

        <p>GIFs are good for animations</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                GIFs are good for simple animations, but they have a limited
                color palette (<em>don't</em> use them for photos)
            </li>
            <li>
                Transparent pixels are also binary (either transparent or
                non-transparent), which means you can't have semi-opaque pixels
            </li>
            <li>Use a PNG if you don't need the image to be animated.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi bouncing gif" />

        <h2>PNGs</h2>

        <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated</li>
            <li>
                A PNG of the same quality (as perceived by the human eye) is
                generally larger than an equivalent JPG file
            </li>
            <li>
                They handle opacity and transparency well, and don't have color
                palette limitations - making them excellent for icons, technical
                diagrams, logos, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img
            src="images/mochi.png"
            alt="mochi png with transparent background"
        />

        <h2>SVGs</h2>

        <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                SVGs are a <em>vector-based</em> graphics format, which means
                that they can scale to <em>any</em> dimension without a loss of
                quality
            </li>
            <li>
                This maeks them great for
                <a
                    href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/responsive-design/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >responsive design</a
                >
            </li>
            <li>They do everything PNGs do, but better.</li>
        </ul>

        <img
            src="images/mochi.svg"
            alt="svg of mochi"
            width="200"
            height="200"
        />
        <p>
            The only disadvantage of svgs is that text fields need to be
            converted to outlines w/ Adobe Illustrator / Sketch. This
            significantly increases the file sizes of images with lots of text
